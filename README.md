### Objective
I'd love to see some alternative remotes for the OD-11 (e.g. an ï£¿Watch App or macOS status menu)

### Current State
The Framework is not finished yet and is likely to undergo breaking API changes before its first release.
A lot of the functionality is already there, though. So if you can't wait, feel free to give it a try!
